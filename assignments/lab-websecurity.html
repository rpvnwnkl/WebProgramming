<h1>COMP 20: Web Programming</h1>
<h2>Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of a Web Application</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perform a security assessment of a potentially vulnerable web application.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>You have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in a working Node.js + Express + MongoDB web application.  The source code and <code>package.json</code> files are provided to you:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="server-vuln.js"><code>server-vuln.js</code></a></li>
	<li><a href="package.json"><code>package.json</code></a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Your goal is to find as many security and privacy problems as you can.  You <span class="stress">must find at least three (3) vulnerabilities in the web application.</span>  You are also allowed to use tools such as <a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/download.html" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a> and curl.</p>

<p><span class="stress">It is not necessary for you to use any of the tools listed above but a good idea nonetheless.</span>  The only deliverable for this portion of the assignment is a security assessment document in HTML5 format in your private GitHub repository: <code>security/index.html</code>.  Your document must have the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Introduction</span> - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do</li>
<li><span class="stress">Methodology</span> - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used</li>
<li><span class="stress">Abstract of Findings</span> - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified.  This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document.  Write this section using lay language.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Issues Found</span> - For each issue that you find, document:
<ul>
<li>Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)</li>
<li>Location / page where issue was found</li>
<li>Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high).  Justify your answer.</li>
<li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is excellent.</li>
<li>Proof of vulnerability.  Screenshots are important.</li>
<li>Resolution.  Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved.  Show code if possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="stress">Conclusion</span> - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can identify multiple instances of a security and privacy issue in your document (i.e., it will count as two issues).  Example: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on two different sections of the web application.</li>
<li>It is important that you <span class="stress">run and test</span> the web application locally on your computer or on a virtual machine!</li>
<li>It is important that you <span class="stress">read</span> the source code!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>This lab is worth 10 points.  I will be assessing your document based on its breadth and depth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Introduction</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Methodology</li>
<li><strong>(2 points)</strong> - Abstract of findings</li>
<li><strong>(3 points)</strong> - Issues found and technical analysis of issues found</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Conclusion</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Grammar, spelling, style (e.g., must be in HTML format)</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - <code>README</code> document exists; report is named <code>index.html</code> in folder named <code>security</code> in your private GitHub repository under the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting the Lab</h2>
<p>Push all your changes to the private repository in GitHub that I created for you in a folder named <code>security</code> under the <code>master</code> branch.  Say that your private repository in GitHub is named <code>comp20-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp20-mchow/security</code>.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p class="directions">Q: Are we supposed to read the downloaded source code in order to make our attacks on the site we are attacking?  Or should we try to do it without going through the source code?  I'm not sure how to tell if attacks are working.</p>
<p>A: Two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, configure and run the web application.  Perform attacks WITHOUT reading the source code.  This is also known as "black box" testing.</li>
<li>Then, download the source code of the web application.  Perform a manual code review of it, and document for your findings.  If you find anything glaring, then go back to the application and attack it.  This is also known as "white box" testing.  For example, after you read the source code and you are suspicious that you can perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack, go ahead an try it out.</li>
</ol>

<p class="directions">Q: Is it necessary to use all the programs listed above? I'm having trouble running Burp Suite specifically.</p>
<p>A: No.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: I'm using a scanning tool and it returned a number of possible vulnerabilities.  Does it mean that the vulnerabilities actually exist?</p>
<p>A: It could also be a false positive.  You have to check in the database, if it went through.  That is, your job is to validate the finding(s).</p>

<p class="directions">Q: Is there a good example of a report?</p>
<p>A: See <a href="security-gjoseph/report.html">Gabe Joseph's report from spring 2013</a>.</p>
