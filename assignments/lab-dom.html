<title>COMP 20: Web Programming - Lab: Document Object Model and Events</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>COMP 20: Web Programming</h1>
<h2>Lab: <span class="stress">Rick Roll</span></h2>

<h2>Lab Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Practice writing JavaScript.</li>
	<li>Practice using the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
	<li>Practice with using JavaScript objects.</li>
	<li>Understand event handling and using first-class function.</li>
	<li>Recognize the power of HTML5.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>HTML5 introduces built-in media support via the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements, offering the ability to easily embed and manipulate media on web pages (Mozilla.org).  In this lab, you will create a web page that annotates a video with text and perhaps other media.</p>

<h2>The Video</h2>
<p>The video that you will annotate is an old song:</p>

<video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/rickroll.mp4" id="rickroll" controls>
</video>
<p>You are free to use the following to access the video on your page and there is no need to make a copy of the video onto your computer:</p>
<pre>
&lt;video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/rickroll.mp4" id="rickroll" controls&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

<h2>Lyrics to "Never Gonna Give You Up"</h2>
<pre>

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Once again, I am going to give you the HTML so you do not have to write it!  Copy and paste the following HTML below as your <code>index.html</code>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Rick Roll&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Rick Roll&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/rickroll.mp4" id="rickroll" controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id="lyrics"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
	// Complete this section and create a CSS file named style.css
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;	
</pre>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Using JavaScript, annotate the video with the stanzas of the song inside the <code>&lt;div id="lyrics"&gt;</code>.  Finally, you must provide some styling for the page via <code>style.css</code>.</p>

<h2>The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Each assignment and lab shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (<code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (<code>README.md</code>).  Markdown is preferred.  No other formats will be accepted.  Please use all capital letters for <code>README</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This <code>README</code> file must be directly in the folder of the lab or assignment.</p>

<h2>Important</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You are not allowed to use jQuery for this lab.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Your Lab</h2>
<p>Push all your files (the HTML, the CSS, the README) to a folder named <code>rickroll</code> inside of the private GitHub repo I created for you.  Say that your private repository is named <code>comp20-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp20-mchow/rickroll</code>. <span class="note">Please do not add and push the video to repository!</span></p>
<pre>
# Inside your private GitHub repo folder (e.g., <code>comp20-mchow</code>)
git add .
git commit -m "<span class="stress">Some good commit message here</span>"
git push
</pre>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>This lab is worth 4 points.</p>
<ul>
	<li>(1 point) The basics (e.g., folder name in private GitHub repository, file names, repo name, README file, one CSS file)</li>
	<li>(3 points) The <code>index.html</code> page following all the instructions above</li>
	<li>(-4 points) You used jQuery</li>
	<li>(-3 points) Errors and outputs (e.g., from <code>console.log statements</code>) exist in JavaScript console</li>
